### Two Pointers Technique ###

The two Pointers Technique is a common algorithmic pattern used to traverse a data structure-typically an array or string - using two indices (Pointers) instead of one. It is especially effective for problems involving searching, comparing, or rearranging elements and often reduces time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Instead of using nested loops, we maintain two pointers that move through the array according to specific rules.

Typical pointers setups:
    1. Left and Right pointers (start from opposite ends)
        => Used when:
            i. The array is sorted
            ii. We want to find a pair, reverse elements, or check conditions

    
    2. Slow and Fast pointers (move at different speeds)
        => Used when:
            i. Removing duplicates
            ii. Detecting cycles
            iii. Modifying arrays in-place


    3. Two pointers on sorted data (used for pair-sum, duplicated, etc.)
        => Used when:
            i. Find two no. sum to target

Why Two Pointers Are Important?

1. Elements nested loops
2. Works in-place (low memory)
3. Frequently asked in coding interviews
4. Used in arrays, strings, listed lists


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


When to Think of Two Pointers?

1. Sorted array problems
2. Pair or triplet problems
3. In-place array modification
4. Comparing elements from both ends
5. Removing duplicated or specific values
